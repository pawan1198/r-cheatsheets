It’s Developed by statisticians for statisticians, R is specifically designed to handle complex data analysis tasks, making it an ideal choice for researchers, data scientists, and analysts across various fields. This essay explores the numerous advantages of R for statistical analysis, including its extensive libraries, community support, data visualization capabilities, and flexibility.\n\n\n1. Comprehensive Statistical Libraries\nOne of the most significant advantages of R is its collection of packages and libraries tailored for statistical analysis. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) hosts thousands of packages that cover a wide range of statistical techniques, from basic descriptive statistics to advanced machine learning algorithms.\nFor instance, packages like data.table, dplyr and tidyr facilitate data manipulation and cleaning, while ggplot2 provides powerful tools for data visualization. More specialized packages, such as base-R for mixed and various statistical in-builts functions and survival for survival analysis, enable users to conduct sophisticated analyses with relative ease. The availability of these packages means that R can be used for virtually any statistical task, making it a one-stop solution for data analysis.\n\n\n2. Strong Community Support\nR boasts a vibrant and active community of users and developers who contribute to its growth and evolution. This community support is invaluable for both novice and experienced users. Online forums, such as Stack Overflow and R-bloggers, statictiaclglobe provide platforms for users to ask questions, share insights, and collaborate on projects. Additionally, the R community regularly organizes conferences, workshops, and meetups, fostering an environment of continuous learning and knowledge sharing. The collaborative nature of the R community also means that users can access a wealth of resources, including tutorials, documentation, and example datasets. This support network is particularly beneficial for those new to statistical analysis, as it allows them to learn from others’ experiences and quickly overcome challenges.\n\n\n3. Data Visualization Capabilities\nEffective data visualization is a crucial aspect of statistical analysis, as it helps to communicate findings clearly and intuitively. R in this area, offering a range of powerful visualization tools that enable users to create high-quality graphics. The ggplot2 package, in particular, has gained widespread acclaim for its ability to produce complex and aesthetically pleasing visualizations with minimal code. With ggplot2, users can create a variety of plots, including scatter plots, line graphs, histograms, and box plots, all while maintaining control over the aesthetics and layout. The grammar of the graphics approach used by ggplot2 allows for layering of visual elements, making it easy to add annotations, customize scales, and combine multiple plots into a single visualization. This flexibility ensures that users can effectively convey their analytical results, making R an excellent choice for presenting data-driven insights.\n\n\n4. Flexibility and Extensibility\nR is an open-source language, which means that users have the freedom to modify and extend its capabilities. This flexibility is particularly advantageous for researchers and analysts who may need to implement custom statistical methods or algorithms. Users can write their functions or modify existing ones to suit their specific needs, allowing for a high degree of customization in their analyses. Moreover, R can easily integrate with other programming languages, such as Python and C++, enabling users to leverage the strengths of multiple languages in their projects. This interoperability allows for the incorporation of R into larger data processing pipelines, making it a versatile tool in a data scientist’s toolkit.\n\n\n5. Reproducibility and Documentation\nReproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, and R provides several tools to ensure that analyses can be easily replicated. The use of R Markdown allows users to create dynamic documents that combine code, output, and narrative text in a single file. This feature not only enhances the clarity of the analysis but also facilitates the sharing of results with others. R Markdown documents can be rendered in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and Word, making it easy to present findings professionally. Additionally, the integration of code and documentation ensures that analyses are transparent and reproducible, which is essential for building trust in research findings.\n\n\n6. Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning\nR is particularly well-suited for statistical modeling and machine learning applications. The language provides a rich set of tools for fitting various statistical models, including linear regression, generalized linear models, and time series analysis. The caret package, for example, offers a unified interface for training and evaluating machine learning models, making it easier for users to experiment with different algorithms and tuning parameters. Furthermore, R’s ability to handle large datasets and perform complex calculations efficiently makes it a strong contender for big data applications. With the advent of packages like data.table and dplyr, R can process large volumes of data quickly, allowing analysts to derive insights from big data without sacrificing performance.\n\n\n7. Integration with Other Tools\nR’s versatility extends to its ability to integrate seamlessly with various data sources and tools. It can connect to databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, enabling users to perform analyses directly on data stored in relational databases. Additionally, R can read and write data in multiple formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON, making it easy to import and export data as needed. Moreover, R can be integrated with web applications and dashboards through packages like Shiny, which allows users to create interactive web applications for data visualization and analysis. This capability is particularly useful for sharing insights with stakeholders who may not have a technical background, as it enables them to explore data and results intuitively.\n\n\n8. Educational Resources and Learning Curve\nFor those new to statistical analysis, R offers a wealth of educational resources that can help users get up to speed quickly. Numerous online courses, tutorials, and textbooks are available, catering to different learning styles and levels of expertise. The availability of these resources makes it easier for individuals to learn R and apply it to their statistical analyses. While R has a reputation for having a steeper learning curve compared to some other programming languages, its syntax is logical and consistent, which can facilitate the learning process. Once users become familiar with the basics, they often find that R’s capabilities and flexibility far outweigh the initial challenges.\n\n\n9. Industry Adoption and Job Market Demand\nR has gained significant traction in various industries, particularly in fields such as finance, healthcare, and academia. Many organizations recognize the value of R for data analysis and statistical modeling, leading to an increasing demand for professionals skilled in R. This trend is reflected in job postings that frequently list R as a required or preferred skill for data analyst and data scientist positions. As more companies adopt data-driven decision-making practices, proficiency in R can enhance career prospects and open doors to new opportunities. The language’s strong reputation in the statistical community further solidifies its position as a valuable asset for anyone looking to advance their career in data analysis.\n\n\n10. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, R stands out as a powerful and flexible tool for statistical analysis, offering a wide range of advantages that cater to the needs of researchers, analysts, and data scientists. Its comprehensive libraries, strong community support, exceptional data visualization capabilities, and flexibility make it an ideal choice for tackling complex data analysis tasks.

    "text": "2.1 Creating objects in R\nYou can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:\n3 + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n12 / 7\n\n[1] 1.714286\nEverything that exists in R is an objects: from simple numerical values, to strings, to more complex objects like vectors, matrices, and lists. Even expressions and functions are objects in R.\nHowever, to do useful and interesting things, we need to name objects. To do so, we need to give a name followed by the assignment operator &lt;-, and the object we want to be named:\narea_hectares &lt;- 1.0\n&lt;- is the assignment operator. It assigns values (objects) on the right to names (also called symbols) on the left. So, after executing x &lt;- 3, the value of x is 3. The arrow can be read as 3 goes into x. For historical reasons, you can also use = for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the slight differences in syntax, it is good practice to always use &lt;- for assignments. More generally we prefer the &lt;- syntax over = because it makes it clear what direction the assignment is operating (left assignment), and it increases the read-ability of the code.\nIn RStudio, typing Alt + - (push Alt at the same time as the - key) will write &lt;- in a single keystroke in a PC, while typing Option + - (push Option at the same time as the - key) does the same in a Mac.\nObjects can be given any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is). R is case sensitive (e.g., age is different from Age). There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental objects in R (e.g., if, else, for, see here for a complete list). In general, even if it’s allowed, it’s best to not use them (e.g., c, T, mean, data, df, weights). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use. It’s also best to avoid dots (.) within an object name as in my.dataset. There are many objects in R with dots in their names for historical reasons, but because dots have a special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages, it’s best to avoid them. The recommended writing style is called snake_case, which implies using only lowercaseletters and numbers and separating each word with underscores (e.g., animals_weight, average_income). It is also recommended to use nouns for object names, and verbs for function names. It’s important to be consistent in the styling of your code (where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.). Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides are Google’s, Jean Fan’s and the tidyverse’s. The tidyverse’s is very comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the lintr package to automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.\nWhen assigning an value to a name, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\narea_hectares &lt;- 1.0    # doesn't print anything\n(area_hectares &lt;- 1.0)  # putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `area_hectares`\n\n[1] 1\n\narea_hectares         # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 1\nNow that R has area_hectares in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this area into acres (area in acres is 2.47 times the area in hectares):\n2.47 * area_hectares\n\n[1] 2.47\nWe can also change an the value assigned to an name by assigning it a new one:\narea_hectares &lt;- 2.5\n2.47 * area_hectares\n\n[1] 6.175\nThis means that assigning a value to one name does not change the values of other names. For example, let’s name the plot’s area in acres area_acres:\narea_acres &lt;- 2.47 * area_hectares\nand then change (reassign) area_hectares to 50.\narea_hectares &lt;- 50\nNow that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of R’s data structures, we are ready to start working with the SAFI dataset we have been using in the other lessons, and learn about data frames.",

In many programming languages, a variable has three aspects: a name, a memory location, and the current value stored in this location. R abstracts from modifiable memory locations. In R we only have objects which cn be named. Depending on the context, name (of an object) and variable can have drastically different meanings.

Including comments to your code has many advantages: it helps you explain your reasoning and it forces you to be tidy. A commented code is also a great tool not only to your collaborators, but to your future self. Comments are the key to a reproducible analysis.\nTo do this in R we use the # character. Anything to the right of the # sign and up to the end of the line is treated as a comment and is ignored by R. You can start lines with comments or include them after any code on the line.\n\narea_hectares &lt;- 1.0            # land area in hectares\narea_acres &lt;- area_hectares * 2.47  # convert to acres\narea_acres              # print land area in acres.\n\n[1] 2.47\n\n\nRStudio makes it easy to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the lines you want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard Ctrl + Shift + C.

    "section": "2.6 Vectors and data types",
    "text": "2.6 Vectors and data types\nA vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function. For example we can create a vector of the number of household members for the households we’ve interviewed and assign it to hh_members:\n\nhh_members &lt;- c(3, 7, 10, 6)\nhh_members\n\n[1]  3  7 10  6\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters. For example, we can have a vector of the building material used to construct our interview respondents’ walls (respondent_wall_type):\n\nrespondent_wall_type &lt;- c(\"muddaub\", \"burntbricks\", \"sunbricks\")\nrespondent_wall_type\n\n[1] \"muddaub\"     \"burntbricks\" \"sunbricks\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “muddaub”, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume there are objects called muddaub, burntbricks and sunbricks. As these names don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\nThere are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. length() tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:\n\nlength(hh_members)\n\n[1] 4\n\nlength(respondent_wall_type)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAn important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function typeof() indicates the type of an object:\n\ntypeof(hh_members)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(respondent_wall_type)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThe function str() provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:\n\nstr(hh_members)\n\n num [1:4] 3 7 10 6\n\nstr(respondent_wall_type)\n\n chr [1:3] \"muddaub\" \"burntbricks\" \"sunbricks\"\n\n\nYou can use the c() function to add other elements to your vector:\n\npossessions &lt;- c(\"bicycle\", \"radio\", \"television\")\npossessions &lt;- c(possessions, \"mobile_phone\") # add to the end of the vector\npossessions &lt;- c(\"car\", possessions) # add to the beginning of the vector\npossessions\n\n[1] \"car\"          \"bicycle\"      \"radio\"        \"television\"   \"mobile_phone\"\n\n\nIn the first line, we take the original vector possessions, add the value \"mobile_phone\" to the end of it, and save the result back into possessions. Then we add the value \"car\" to the beginning, again saving the result back into possessions.\nWe can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.\nAn atomic vector is the simplest R data type and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main atomic vector types that R uses: \"character\" and \"numeric\" (or \"double\"). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from. The other 4 atomic vector types are:\n\n\"logical\" for TRUE and FALSE (the boolean data type)\n\"integer\" for integer numbers (e.g., 2L, the L indicates to R that it’s an integer)\n\"complex\" to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 1 + 4i) and that’s all we’re going to say about them\n\"raw\" for bitstreams that we won’t discuss further\n\nYou can check the type of your vector using the typeof() function and inputting your vector as the argument.\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array).",

    "text": "2.7 Exercise\nWe’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?\n\nSolution (Solution). R implicitly converts them to all be the same type.\n\nWhat will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects):\n\nnum_char &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, \"a\")\nnum_logical &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", TRUE)\ntricky &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, \"4\")\n\nWhy do you think it happens?\n\nSolution (Solution). Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a “common denominator” that doesn’t lose any information.\n\nHow many values in combined_logical are \"TRUE\" (as a character) in the following example:\n\nnum_logical &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", TRUE)\ncombined_logical &lt;- c(num_logical, char_logical)\n\n\nSolution (Solution). Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the TRUE in num_logical gets converted into a 1 before it gets converted into \"1\" in combined_logical.\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that objects of different types get converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class coercion. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?",

    "section": "2.8 Subsetting vectors",
    "text": "2.8 Subsetting vectors\nSubsetting (sometimes referred to as extracting or indexing) involves accessing out one or more values based on their numeric placement or “index” within a vector. If we want to subset one or several values from a vector, we must provide one index or several indices in square brackets. For instance:\n\nrespondent_wall_type &lt;- c(\"muddaub\", \"burntbricks\", \"sunbricks\")\nrespondent_wall_type[2]\n\n[1] \"burntbricks\"\n\nrespondent_wall_type[c(3, 2)]\n\n[1] \"sunbricks\"   \"burntbricks\"\n\n\nWe can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:\n\nmore_respondent_wall_type &lt;- respondent_wall_type[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3)]\nmore_respondent_wall_type\n\n[1] \"muddaub\"     \"burntbricks\" \"sunbricks\"   \"burntbricks\" \"muddaub\"    \n[6] \"sunbricks\"  \n\n\nR indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that’s what human beings typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that’s simpler for computers to do.\n\n2.8.1 Conditional subsetting\nAnother common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. TRUE will select the element with the same index, while FALSE will not:\n\nhh_members &lt;- c(3, 7, 10, 6)\nhh_members[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]\n\n[1]  3 10  6\n\n\nTypically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you wanted to select only the values above 5:\n\nhh_members &gt; 5    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n## so we can use this to select only the values above 5\nhh_members[hh_members &gt; 5]\n\n[1]  7 10  6\n\n\nYou can combine multiple tests using & (both conditions are true, AND) or | (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):\n\nhh_members[hh_members &lt; 4 | hh_members &gt; 7]\n\n[1]  3 10\n\nhh_members[hh_members &gt;= 4 & hh_members &lt;= 7]\n\n[1] 7 6\n\n\nHere, &lt; stands for “less than”, &gt; for “greater than”, &gt;= for “greater than or equal to”, and == for “equal to”. The double equal sign == is a test for numerical equality between the left and right hand sides, and should not be confused with the single = sign, which performs variable assignment (similar to &lt;-).\nA common task is to search for certain strings in a vector. One could use the “or” operator | to test for equality to multiple values, but this can quickly become tedious.\n\npossessions &lt;- c(\"car\", \"bicycle\", \"radio\", \"television\", \"mobile_phone\")\npossessions[possessions == \"car\" | possessions == \"bicycle\"] # returns both car and bicycle\n\n[1] \"car\"     \"bicycle\"\n\n\nThe function %in% allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector (on the left hand side) are found in the target vector (on the right hand side):\n\npossessions %in% c(\"car\", \"bicycle\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nNote that the output is the same length as the search vector on the left hand side, because %in% checks whether each element of the search vector is found somewhere in the target vector. Thus, you can use %in% to select the elements in the search vector that appear in your target vector:\n\npossessions %in% c(\"car\", \"bicycle\", \"motorcycle\", \"truck\", \"boat\", \"bus\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\npossessions[possessions %in% c(\"car\", \"bicycle\", \"motorcycle\", \"truck\", \"boat\", \"bus\")]\n\n[1] \"car\"     \"bicycle\"",

    "section": "3.3 Importing data",
    "text": "3.3 Importing data\nYou are going to load the data in R’s memory using the function read_csv() from the readr package, which is part of the tidyverse; learn more about the tidyverse collection of packages here. readr gets installed as part as the tidyverse installation. When you load the tidyverse (library(tidyverse)), the core packages (the packages used in most data analyses) get loaded, including readr.\nBefore proceeding, however, this is a good opportunity to talk about conflicts. Certain packages we load can end up introducing function names that are already in use by pre-loaded R packages. For instance, when we load the tidyverse package below, we will introduce two conflicting functions: filter() and lag(). This happens because filter and lag are already functions used by the stats package (already pre-loaded in R). What will happen now is that if we, for example, call the filter() function, R will use the dplyr::filter() version and not the stats::filter() one. This happens because, if conflicted, by default R uses the function from the most recently loaded package. Conflicted functions may cause you some trouble in the future, so it is important that we are aware of them so that we can properly handle them, if we want.\nTo do so, we just need the following functions from the conflicted package:\n\nconflicted::conflict_scout(): Shows us any conflicted functions.\n\nconflict_prefer(\"function\", \"package_prefered\"): Allows us to choose the default function we want from now on.\n\nIt is also important to know that we can, at any time, just call the function directly from the package we want, such as stats::filter().\nEven with the use of an RStudio project, it can be difficult to learn how to specify paths to file locations. Enter the here package! The here package creates paths relative to the top-level directory (your RStudio project). These relative paths work regardless of where the associated source file lives inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports in different subdirectories. This is an important contrast to using setwd(), which depends on the way you order your files on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Allison Horst\n\n\nBefore we can use the read_csv() and here() functions, we need to load the tidyverse and here packages.\nAlso, if you recall, the missing data is encoded as “NULL” in the dataset. We’ll tell it to the function, so R will automatically convert all the “NULL” entries in the dataset into NA.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\ninterviews &lt;- read_csv(\n  here(\"data\", \"SAFI_clean.csv\"), \n  na = \"NULL\")\n\nIn the above code, we notice the here() function takes folder and file names as inputs (e.g., \"data\", \"SAFI_clean.csv\"), each enclosed in quotations (\"\") and separated by a comma. The here() will accept as many names as are necessary to navigate to a particular file (e.g., here(\"analysis\", \"data\", \"surveys\", \"clean\", \"SAFI_clean.csv)).\nThe here() function can accept the folder and file names in an alternate format, using a slash (“/”) rather than commas to separate the names. The two methods are equivalent, so that here(\"data\", \"SAFI_clean.csv\") and here(\"data/SAFI_clean.csv\") produce the same result. (The slash is used on all operating systems; backslashes are not used.)\nIf you were to type in the code above, it is likely that the read.csv() function would appear in the automatically populated list of functions. This function is different from the read_csv() function, as it is included in the “base” packages that come pre-installed with R. Overall, read.csv() behaves similar to read_csv(), with a few notable differences. First, read.csv() coerces column names with spaces and/or special characters to different names (e.g. interview date becomes interview.date). Second, read.csv() stores data as a data.frame, where read_csv() stores data as a different kind of data frame called a tibble. We prefer tibbles because they have nice printing properties among other desirable qualities. Read more about tibbles here.\nThe second statement in the code above creates a data frame but doesn’t output any data because, as you might recall, assignments (&lt;-) don’t display anything. (Note, however, that read_csv may show informational text about the data frame that is created.) If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: interviews in the console.\n\ninterviews\n## Try also\n## view(interviews)\n## head(interviews)\n\n# A tibble: 131 × 14\n   key_ID village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1      1 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         4 muddaub             \n 2      2 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         7         9 muddaub             \n 3      3 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00        10        15 burntbricks         \n 4      4 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         7         6 burntbricks         \n 5      5 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         7        40 burntbricks         \n 6      6 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         3 muddaub             \n 7      7 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         6        38 muddaub             \n 8      8 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        70 burntbricks         \n 9      9 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8         6 burntbricks         \n10     10 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n# ℹ 121 more rows\n# ℹ 8 more variables: rooms &lt;dbl&gt;, memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt;, affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   liv_count &lt;dbl&gt;, items_owned &lt;chr&gt;, no_meals &lt;dbl&gt;, months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   instanceID &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneNote\n\n\n\nread_csv() assumes that fields are delimited by commas. However, in several countries, the comma is used as a decimal separator and the semicolon (;) is used as a field delimiter. If you want to read in this type of files in R, you can use the read_csv2 function. It behaves exactly like read_csv but uses different parameters for the decimal and the field separators. If you are working with another format, they can be both specified by the user. Check out the help for read_csv() by typing ?read_csv to learn more. There is also the read_tsv() for tab-separated data files, and read_delim() allows you to specify more details about the structure of your file.\n\n\nNote that read_csv() actually loads the data as a tibble. A tibble is an extension of R data frames used by the tidyverse. When the data is read using read_csv(), it is stored in an object of class tbl_df, tbl, and data.frame. You can see the class of an object with\n\nclass(interviews)\n\n[1] \"spec_tbl_df\" \"tbl_df\"      \"tbl\"         \"data.frame\" \n\n\nAs a tibble, the type of data included in each column is listed in an abbreviated fashion below the column names. For instance, here key_ID is a column of floating point numbers (abbreviated &lt;dbl&gt; for the word ‘double’), village is a column of characters (&lt;chr&gt;) and the interview_date is a column in the “date and time” format (&lt;dttm&gt;).",

    "text": "3.4 Inspecting data frames\nWhen calling a tbl_df object (like interviews here), there is already a lot of information about our data frame being displayed such as the number of rows, the number of columns, the names of the columns, and as we just saw the class of data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this information from data frames. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these functions. Let’s try them out!\nSize:\n\ndim(interviews) - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the dimensions of the object)\nnrow(interviews) - returns the number of rows\nncol(interviews) - returns the number of columns\n\nContent:\n\nhead(interviews) - shows the first 6 rows\ntail(interviews) - shows the last 6 rows\n\nNames:\n\nnames(interviews) - returns the column names (synonym of colnames() for data.frame objects)\n\nSummary:\n\nstr(interviews) - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column\nsummary(interviews) - summary statistics for each column\nglimpse(interviews) - returns the number of columns and rows of the tibble, the names and class of each column, and previews as many values will fit on the screen. Unlike the other inspecting functions listed above, glimpse() is not a “base R” function so you need to have the dplyr or tibble packages loaded to be able to execute it.\n\nNote: most of these functions are “generic.” They can be used on other types of objects besides data frames or tibbles.",

In practice, we may not need the entire data frame; for instance, we may only be interested in a subset of the observations (the rows) or a particular set of variables (the columns).

Row numbers come first, followed by column numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneTip\n\n\n\nSubsetting a tibble with [ always results in a tibble.

    "section": "3.7 Factors",
    "text": "3.7 Factors\nR has a special data class, called factor, to deal with categorical data that you may encounter when creating plots or doing statistical analyses. Factors are very useful and actually contribute to making R particularly well suited to working with data. So we are going to spend a little time introducing them.\nFactors represent categorical data. They are stored as integers associated with labels and they can be ordered (ordinal) or unordered (nominal). Factors create a structured relation between the different levels (values) of a categorical variable, such as days of the week or responses to a question in a survey. This can make it easier to see how one element relates to the other elements in a column. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually treated as integer vectors by R. So you need to be very careful when treating them as strings.\nOnce created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, known as levels. By default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:\n\nrespondent_floor_type &lt;- factor(c(\"earth\", \"cement\", \"cement\", \"earth\"))\n\nR will assign 1 to the level \"cement\" and 2 to the level \"earth\" (because c comes before e, even though the first element in this vector is \"earth\"). You can see this by using the function levels() and you can find the number of levels using nlevels():\n\nlevels(respondent_floor_type)\n\n[1] \"cement\" \"earth\" \n\nnlevels(respondent_floor_type)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nSometimes, the order of the factors does not matter. Other times you might want to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., “low”, “medium”, “high”). It may improve your visualization, or it may be required by a particular type of analysis. Here, one way to reorder our levels in the respondent_floor_type vector would be:\n\nrespondent_floor_type # current order\n\n[1] earth  cement cement earth \nLevels: cement earth\n\nrespondent_floor_type &lt;- factor(respondent_floor_type, \n                                levels = c(\"earth\", \"cement\"))\n\nrespondent_floor_type # after re-ordering\n\n[1] earth  cement cement earth \nLevels: earth cement\n\n\nIn R’s memory, these factors are represented by integers (1, 2), but are more informative than integers because factors are self describing: \"cement\", \"earth\" is more descriptive than 1, and 2. Which one is “earth”? You wouldn’t be able to tell just from the integer data. Factors, on the other hand, have this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels. It also makes renaming levels easier. Let’s say we made a mistake and need to recode “cement” to “brick”. We can do this using the fct_recode() function from the forcats package (included in the tidyverse) which provides some extra tools to work with factors.\n\nlevels(respondent_floor_type)\n\n[1] \"earth\"  \"cement\"\n\nrespondent_floor_type &lt;- fct_recode(respondent_floor_type, brick = \"cement\")\n\n## as an alternative, we could change the \"cement\" level directly using the\n## levels() function, but we have to remember that \"cement\" is the second level\n# levels(respondent_floor_type)[2] &lt;- \"brick\"\n\nlevels(respondent_floor_type)\n\n[1] \"earth\" \"brick\"\n\nrespondent_floor_type\n\n[1] earth brick brick earth\nLevels: earth brick\n\n\nSo far, your factor is unordered, like a nominal variable. R does not know the difference between a nominal and an ordinal variable. You make your factor an ordered factor by using the ordered=TRUE option inside your factor function. Note how the reported levels changed from the unordered factor above to the ordered version below. Ordered levels use the less than sign &lt; to denote level ranking.\n\nrespondent_floor_type_ordered &lt;- factor(respondent_floor_type, \n                                        ordered = TRUE)\n\nrespondent_floor_type_ordered # after setting as ordered factor\n\n[1] earth brick brick earth\nLevels: earth &lt; brick\n\n\n\n3.7.1 Converting factors\nIf you need to convert a factor to a character vector, you use as.character(x).\n\nas.character(respondent_floor_type)\n\n[1] \"earth\" \"brick\" \"brick\" \"earth\"\n\n\nConverting factors where the levels appear as numbers (such as concentration levels, or years) to a numeric vector is a little trickier. The as.numeric() function returns the index values of the factor, not its levels, so it will result in an entirely new (and unwanted in this case) set of numbers. One method to avoid this is to convert factors to characters, and then to numbers. Another method is to use the levels() function. Compare:\n\nyear_fct &lt;- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))\n\nas.numeric(year_fct)                     # Wrong! And there is no warning...\n\n[1] 3 2 1 4 3\n\nas.numeric(as.character(year_fct))       # Works...\n\n[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990\n\nas.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]   # The recommended way.\n\n[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990\n\n\nNotice that in the recommended levels() approach, three important steps occur:\n\nWe obtain all the factor levels using levels(year_fct)\nWe convert these levels to numeric values using as.numeric(levels(year_fct))\nWe then access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the vector year_fct inside the square brackets\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Renaming factors\nWhen your data is stored as a factor, you can use the plot() function to get a quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor level.

    "section": "3.9 Formatting Dates",
    "text": "3.9 Formatting Dates\nOne of the most common issues that new (and experienced!) R users have is converting date and time information into a variable that is appropriate and usable during analyses. A best practice for dealing with date data is to ensure that each component of your date is available as a separate variable. In our dataset, we have a column interview_date which contains information about the year, month, and day that the interview was conducted. Let’s convert those dates into three separate columns.\n\nstr(interviews)\n\nWe are going to use the package lubridate, , which is included in the tidyverse installation and should be loaded by default. However, if we deal with older versions of tidyverse (2022 and ealier), we can manually load it by typing library(lubridate).\nIf necessary, start by loading the required package:\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nThe lubridate function ymd() takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts it to a Date vector. Date is a class of data recognized by R as being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the function requires is flexible, but, as a best practice, is a character vector formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD”.\nLet’s extract our interview_date column and inspect the structure:\n\ndates &lt;- interviews$interview_date\nstr(dates)\n\n POSIXct[1:131], format: \"2016-11-17\" \"2016-11-17\" \"2016-11-17\" \"2016-11-17\" \"2016-11-17\" ...\n\n\nWhen we imported the data in R, read_csv() recognized that this column contained date information. We can now use the day(), month() and year() functions to extract this information from the date, and create new columns in our data frame to store it:\n\ninterviews$day &lt;- day(dates)\ninterviews$month &lt;- month(dates)\ninterviews$year &lt;- year(dates)\ninterviews\n\n# A tibble: 131 × 17\n   key_ID village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1      1 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         4 muddaub             \n 2      2 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         7         9 muddaub             \n 3      3 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00        10        15 burntbricks         \n 4      4 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         7         6 burntbricks         \n 5      5 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         7        40 burntbricks         \n 6      6 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         3 muddaub             \n 7      7 God      2016-11-17 00:00:00         6        38 muddaub             \n 8      8 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        70 burntbricks         \n 9      9 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8         6 burntbricks         \n10     10 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n# ℹ 121 more rows\n# ℹ 11 more variables: rooms &lt;dbl&gt;, memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt;, affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   liv_count &lt;dbl&gt;, items_owned &lt;chr&gt;, no_meals &lt;dbl&gt;, months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   instanceID &lt;chr&gt;, day &lt;int&gt;, month &lt;dbl&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNotice the three new columns at the end of our data frame.\nIn our example above, the interview_date column was read in correctly as a Date variable but generally that is not the case. Date columns are often read in as character variables and one can use the as_date() function to convert them to the appropriate Date/POSIXctformat.\nLet’s say we have a vector of dates in character format:\n\nchar_dates &lt;- c(\"7/31/2012\", \"8/9/2014\", \"4/30/2016\")\nstr(char_dates)\n\n chr [1:3] \"7/31/2012\" \"8/9/2014\" \"4/30/2016\"\n\n\nWe can convert this vector to dates as :\n\nas_date(char_dates, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n\n[1] \"2012-07-31\" \"2014-08-09\" \"2016-04-30\"\n\n\nArgument format tells the function the order to parse the characters and identify the month, day and year. The format above is the equivalent of mm/dd/yyyy. A wrong format can lead to parsing errors or incorrect results.\nFor example, observe what happens when we use a lower case y instead of upper case Y for the year.\n\nas_date(char_dates, format = \"%m/%d/%y\")\n\nWarning: 3 failed to parse.\n\n\n[1] NA NA NA\n\n\nHere, the %y part of the format stands for a two-digit year instead of a four-digit year, and this leads to parsing errors.\nOr in the following example, observe what happens when the month and day elements of the format are switched.\n\nas_date(char_dates, format = \"%d/%m/%y\")\n\nWarning: 3 failed to parse.\n\n\n[1] NA NA NA\n\n\nSince there is no month numbered 30 or 31, the first and third dates cannot be parsed.\nWe can also use functions ymd(), mdy() or dmy() to convert character variables to date.\n\nmdy(char_dates)\n\n[1] \"2012-07-31\" \"2014-08-09\" \"2016-04-30\"\n\n\n\n\nUse read_csv to read tabular data in R.\nUse factors to represent categorical data in R.",

While the first column can be character, the second and third can be numeric or logical. However, each column should have the same type of data.\nUse the data.frame() function to create a data frame:\nExample # Create a data frame\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n# Print the data frame\nData_Frame\n\n  Training Pulse Duration\n1 Strength   100       60\n2  Stamina   150       30\n3    Other   120       45\n\n\n\n\n6 Summarize the Data\nUse the summary() function to summarize the data from a Data Frame:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\nData_Frame\n\n  Training Pulse Duration\n1 Strength   100       60\n2  Stamina   150

:150.0   Max.   :60.0  \n\n\nYou will learn more about the summary() function in the statistical part of the R tutorial.\nAccess Items We can use single brackets [ ], double brackets [[ ]] or $ to access columns from a data frame:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30,

\"Stamina\"  \"Other\"   \n\n\nAdd Rows Use the rbind() function to add new rows in a Data Frame:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\n# Add a new row\nNew_row_DF &lt;- rbind(Data_Frame, c(\"Strength\", 110, 110))\n\n# Print the new row\nNew_row_DF\n\n  Training Pulse

Frame:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\n# Add a new column\nNew_col_DF &lt;- cbind(Data_Frame, Steps = c(1000, 6000, 2000))\n\n# Print the new column\nNew_col_DF\n\n  Training Pulse Duration Steps\n1 Strength   100       60  1000\n2  Stamina   150       30  6000\n3    Other   120       45  2000\n\n\nRemove Rows and Columns Use the c() function to remove rows and columns in a Data Frame:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\n# Remove the first row and column\nData_Frame_New &lt;- Data_Frame[-c(1), -c(1)]\n\n# Print the new data frame\nData_Frame_New\n\n  Pulse Duration\n2   150       30\n3   120       45\n\n\nAmount of Rows and Columns Use the dim() function to find the amount of rows and columns in a Data Frame:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\ndim(Data_Frame)\n\n[1] 3 3\n\n\nYou can also use the ncol() function to find the number of columns and nrow() to find the number of rows:\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\nncol(Data_Frame)\n\n[1] 3\n\nnrow(Data_Frame)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nData Frame Length Use the length() function to find the number of columns in a Data Frame (similar to ncol()):\nExample\n\nData_Frame &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\nlength(Data_Frame)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nCombining Data Frames Use the rbind() function to combine two or more data frames in R vertically:\nExample\n\nData_Frame1 &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\nData_Frame2 &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Stamina\", \"Stamina\", \"Strength\"),\n  Pulse = c(140, 150, 160),\n  Duration = c(30, 30, 20)\n)\n\nNew_Data_Frame &lt;- rbind(Data_Frame1, Data_Frame2)\nNew_Data_Frame\n\n  Training Pulse Duration\n1 Strength   100       60\n2  Stamina   150       30\n3    Other   120       45\n4  Stamina   140       30\n5  Stamina   150       30\n6 Strength   160       20\n\n\nAnd use the cbind() function to combine two or more data frames in R horizontally:\nExample\n\nData_Frame3 &lt;- data.frame (\n  Training = c(\"Strength\", \"Stamina\", \"Other\"),\n  Pulse = c(100, 150, 120),\n  Duration = c(60, 30, 45)\n)\n\nData_Frame4 &lt;-

Vectors are one-dimensional data structures.\nVector is one of the basic data structures in R. It is homogeneous, which means that it only contains elements of the same data type. Data types can be numeric, integer, character, complex, or logical.\nVectors are created by using the c() function. Coercion takes place in a vector, from bottom to top, if the elements passed are of different data types, from logical to integer to double to character.\nThe class() function is used to check the class of the vector.\n\n# Vectors(ordered collection of same data type)\nX = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8)\nX\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 8\n\nVec1 &lt;- c(44, 25, 64, 96, 30)\nVec1\n\n[1] 44 25 64 96 30\n\nVec2 &lt;- c(1, FALSE, 9.8, \"hello world\")\nVec2\n\n[1] \"1\"           \"FALSE\"       \"9.8\"         \"hello world\"\n\nclass(X)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(Vec1)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(Vec2)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nElements of a vector can be accessed by using their respective indexes.

In a matrix, as we know rows are the ones that run horizontally and columns are the ones that run vertically. Matrices are two-dimensional, homogeneous data structures.

It is built to work directly with dataframes, with many common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++) (not all R packages are written in R!).\nThere are also packages available for a wide range of tasks including building plots (ggplot2, which we’ll see later), downloading data from the NCBI database, or performing statistical analysis on your data set. Many packages such as these are housed on, and downloadable from, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) using install.packages. This function makes the package accessible by your R installation with the command library(), as you did with tidyverse earlier.\nTo easily access the documentation for a package within R or RStudio, use help(package = \"package_name\").\nTo learn more about dplyr after the workshop, you may want to check out this handy data transformation with dplyr cheatsheet.",

The first argument to this function is the dataframe (interviews), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep, separated by commas. Alternatively, if you are selecting columns adjacent to each other, you can use a : to select a range of columns, read as “select columns from ___ to ___.” You may have done something similar in the past using subsetting. select() is essentially doing the same thing as subsetting, using a package (dplyr) instead of R’s base functions.\n\n# to select columns throughout the dataframe\nselect(interviews, village, no_membrs, months_lack_food)\n# to do the same thing with subsetting\ninterviews[c(\"village\",\"no_membrs\",\"months_lack_food\")]\n# to select a series of connected columns\nselect(interviews, village:respondent_wall_type)\n\nTo choose rows based on specific criteria, we can use the filter() function. The argument after the dataframe is the condition we want our final dataframe to adhere to (e.g. village name is Chirodzo):\n\n# filters observations where village name is \"Chirodzo\"\nfilter(interviews, village == \"Chirodzo\")\n\n# A tibble: 39 × 14\n   key_ID village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1      8 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        70 burntbricks         \n 2      9 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8         6 burntbricks         \n 3     10 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 4     34 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         8        18 burntbricks         \n 5     35 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         5        45 muddaub             \n 6     36 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         6        23 sunbricks           \n 7     37 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         8 burntbricks         \n 8     43 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         7        29 muddaub             \n 9     44 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         2         6 muddaub             \n10     45 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         9         7 muddaub             \n# ℹ 29 more rows\n# ℹ 8 more variables: rooms &lt;dbl&gt;, memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt;, affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   liv_count &lt;dbl&gt;, items_owned &lt;chr&gt;, no_meals &lt;dbl&gt;, months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   instanceID &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nYou may also have noticed that the output from these call doesn’t run off the screen anymore. It’s one of the advantages of tbl_df (also called tibble), the central data class in the tidyverse, compared to normal dataframes in R.\nWe can also specify multiple conditions within the filter() function. We can combine conditions using either “and” or “or” statements. In an “and” statement, an observation (row) must meet every criteria to be included in the resulting dataframe. To form “and” statements within dplyr, we can pass our desired conditions as arguments in the filter() function, separated by commas:\n\n# filters observations with \"and\" operator (comma)\n# output dataframe satisfies ALL specified conditions\nfilter(interviews, village == \"Chirodzo\",\n                   rooms &gt; 1,\n                   no_meals &gt; 2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 14\n   key_ID village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1     10 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 2     49 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         6        26 burntbricks         \n 3     52 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        11        15 burntbricks         \n 4     56 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 5     65 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8        20 burntbricks         \n 6     66 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        10        37 burntbricks         \n 7     67 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         5        31 burntbricks         \n 8     68 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8        52 burntbricks         \n 9    199 Chirodzo 2017-06-04 00:00:00         7        17 burntbricks         \n10    200 Chirodzo 2017-06-04 00:00:00         8        20 burntbricks         \n# ℹ 8 more variables: rooms &lt;dbl&gt;, memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt;, affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   liv_count &lt;dbl&gt;, items_owned &lt;chr&gt;, no_meals &lt;dbl&gt;, months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   instanceID &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nWe can also form “and” statements with the & operator instead of commas:\n\n# filters observations with \"&\" logical operator\n# output dataframe satisfies ALL specified conditions\nfilter(interviews, village == \"Chirodzo\" &\n                   rooms &gt; 1 &\n                   no_meals &gt; 2)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 14\n   key_ID village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1     10 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 2     49 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         6        26 burntbricks         \n 3     52 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        11        15 burntbricks         \n 4     56 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 5     65 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8        20 burntbricks         \n 6     66 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        10        37 burntbricks         \n 7     67 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         5        31 burntbricks         \n 8     68 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8        52 burntbricks         \n 9    199 Chirodzo 2017-06-04 00:00:00         7        17 burntbricks         \n10    200 Chirodzo 2017-06-04 00:00:00         8        20 burntbricks         \n# ℹ 8 more variables: rooms &lt;dbl&gt;, memb_assoc &lt;chr&gt;, affect_conflicts &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   liv_count &lt;dbl&gt;, items_owned &lt;chr&gt;, no_meals &lt;dbl&gt;, months_lack_food &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   instanceID &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nIn an “or” statement, observations must meet at least one of the specified conditions.

    "section": "6.4 Pipes",
    "text": "6.4 Pipes\nWhat if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.\nWith intermediate steps, you create a temporary dataframe and use that as input to the next function, like this:\n\ninterviews2 &lt;- filter(interviews, village == \"Chirodzo\")\ninterviews_ch &lt;- select(interviews2, village:respondent_wall_type)\n\nThis is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.\nYou can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:\n\ninterviews_ch &lt;- select(filter(interviews, village == \"Chirodzo\"),\n                         village:respondent_wall_type)\n\nThis is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).\nThe last option, pipes, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. There are two Pipes in R: 1) %&gt;% (called magrittr pipe; made available via the magrittr package, installed automatically with dplyr) or 2) |&gt; (called native R pipe and it comes preinstalled with R v4.1.0 onwards). Both the pipes are, by and large, function similarly with a few differences (For more information, check: https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/). The choice of which pipe to be used can be changed in the Global settings in R studio and once that is done, you can type the pipe with:\n\nCtrl + Shift + M if you have a PC or Cmd + Shift + M if you have a Mac.\n\n\n# the following example is run using magrittr pipe but the output will be same with the native pipe\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    filter(village == \"Chirodzo\") %&gt;%\n    select(village:respondent_wall_type)\n\n# A tibble: 39 × 5\n   village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        70 burntbricks         \n 2 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8         6 burntbricks         \n 3 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 4 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         8        18 burntbricks         \n 5 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         5        45 muddaub             \n 6 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         6        23 sunbricks           \n 7 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         8 burntbricks         \n 8 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         7        29 muddaub             \n 9 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         2         6 muddaub             \n10 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         9         7 muddaub             \n# ℹ 29 more rows\n\n#interviews |&gt;\n#   filter(village == \"Chirodzo\") |&gt;\n#   select(village:respondent_wall_type)\n\nIn the above code, we use the pipe to send the interviews dataset first through filter() to keep rows where village is “Chirodzo”, then through select() to keep only the columns from village to respondent_wall_type. Since %&gt;% takes the object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don’t need to explicitly include the dataframe as an argument to the filter() and select() functions any more.\nSome may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then”. For instance, in the above example, we take the dataframe interviews, then we filter for rows with village == \"Chirodzo\", then we select columns village:respondent_wall_type. The dplyr functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex data wrangling operations.\nIf we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:\n\ninterviews_ch &lt;- interviews %&gt;%\n    filter(village == \"Chirodzo\") %&gt;%\n    select(village:respondent_wall_type)\n\ninterviews_ch\n\n# A tibble: 39 × 5\n   village  interview_date      no_membrs years_liv respondent_wall_type\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dttm&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               \n 1 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00        12        70 burntbricks         \n 2 Chirodzo 2016-11-16 00:00:00         8         6 burntbricks         \n 3 Chirodzo 2016-12-16 00:00:00        12        23 burntbricks         \n 4 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         8        18 burntbricks         \n 5 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         5        45 muddaub             \n 6 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         6        23 sunbricks           \n 7 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         3         8 burntbricks         \n 8 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         7        29 muddaub             \n 9 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         2         6 muddaub             \n10 Chirodzo 2016-11-17 00:00:00         9         7 muddaub             \n# ℹ 29 more rows\n\n\nNote that the final dataframe (interviews_ch) is the leftmost part of this expression.",

    "text": "6.8 Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function\nMany data analysis tasks can be approached using the split-apply-combine paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. dplyr makes this very easy through the use of the group_by() function.\n\n6.8.1 The summarize() function\ngroup_by() is often used together with summarize(), which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group. group_by() takes as arguments the column names that contain the categorical variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the average household size by village:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    group_by(village) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  village  mean_no_membrs\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Chirodzo           7.08\n2 God                6.86\n3 Ruaca              7.57\n\n\nYou can also group by multiple columns:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'village'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n# Groups:   village [3]\n  village  memb_assoc mean_no_membrs\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Chirodzo no                   8.06\n2 Chirodzo yes                  7.82\n3 Chirodzo &lt;NA&gt;                 5.08\n4 God      no                   7.13\n5 God      yes                  8   \n6 God      &lt;NA&gt;                 6   \n7 Ruaca    no                   7.18\n8 Ruaca    yes                  9.5 \n9 Ruaca    &lt;NA&gt;                 6.22\n\n\nNote that the output is a grouped tibble of nine rows by three columns which is indicated by the by two first lines with the #. To obtain an ungrouped tibble, use the ungroup function:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs)) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'village'.

When grouping both by village and membr_assoc, we see rows in our table for respondents who did not specify whether they were a member of an irrigation association. We can exclude those data from our table using a filter step.\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %&gt;%\n    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'village'.

For instance, we could add a column indicating the minimum household size for each village for each group (members of an irrigation association vs not):\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %&gt;%\n    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),\n              min_membrs = min(no_membrs))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'village'.

For instance, we can sort on min_membrs to put the group with the smallest household first:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %&gt;%\n    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),\n              min_membrs = min(no_membrs)) %&gt;%\n    arrange(min_membrs)\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'village'.

If we want to sort the results by decreasing order of minimum household size:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %&gt;%\n    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),\n              min_membrs = min(no_membrs)) %&gt;%\n    arrange(desc(min_membrs))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'village'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n# Groups:   village [3]\n  village  memb_assoc mean_no_membrs min_membrs\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 God      yes                  8             5\n2 Ruaca    yes                  9.5           5\n3 Chirodzo no                   8.06          4\n4 God      no                   7.13          3\n5 Chirodzo yes                  7.82          2\n6 Ruaca    no                   7.18          2\n\n\n\n\n6.8.2 Counting\nWhen working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, dplyr provides count(). For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each village, we would do:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    count(village)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  village      n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 Chirodzo    39\n2 God         43\n3 Ruaca       49\n\n\nFor convenience, count() provides the sort argument to get results in decreasing order:\n\ninterviews %&gt;%\n    count(village, sort = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  village      n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 Ruaca       49\n2 God         43\n3 Chirodzo    39",

It is stated that the key_ID was “added to provide a unique Id for each observation” and the instanceID “does this as well but it is not as convenient to use.”\nOnce we have established that key_ID and instanceID are both unique we can use either variable as an identifier corresponding to the 131 interview records.\n\ninterviews %&gt;% \n  select(key_ID) %&gt;% \n  distinct() %&gt;% \n  count()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      n\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1   131\n\n\n\ninterviews %&gt;% \n  select(instanceID) %&gt;% \n  distinct() %&gt;% \n  count()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      n\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1   131\n\n\nAs seen in the code below, for each interview date in each village no instanceIDs are the same.

But, we notice that each column represents a different variable. In the “longest” data format there would only be three columns, one for the id variable, one for the observed variable, and one for the observed value (of that variable). This data format is quite unsightly and difficult to work with, so you will rarely see it in use.\nAlternatively, in a “wide” data format we see modifications to rule 1, where each column no longer represents a single variable. Instead, columns can represent different levels/values of a variable. For instance, in some data you encounter the researchers may have chosen for every survey date to be a different column.\nThese may sound like dramatically different data layouts, but there are some tools that make transitions between these layouts much simpler than you might think! The gif below shows how these two formats relate to each other, and gives you an idea of how we can use R to shift from one format to the other.\n Long and wide dataframe layouts mainly affect readability. You may find that visually you may prefer the “wide” format, since you can see more of the data on the screen. However, all of the R functions we have used thus far expect for your data to be in a “long” data format. This is because the long format is more machine readable and is closer to the formatting of databases.\n\n\n7.1.2 Questions which warrant different data formats\nIn interviews, each row contains the values of variables associated with each record (the unit), values such as the village of the respondent, the number of household members, or the type of wall their house had. This format allows for us to make comparisons across individual surveys, but what if we wanted to look at differences in households grouped by different types of items owned?\nTo facilitate this comparison we would need to create a new table where each row (the unit) was comprised of values of variables associated with items owned (i.e., items_owned). In practical terms this means the values of the items in items_owned (e.g. bicycle, radio, table, etc.) would become the names of column variables and the cells would contain values of TRUE or FALSE, for whether that household had that item.\nOnce we we’ve created this new table, we can explore the relationship within and between villages. The key point here is that we are still following a tidy data structure, but we have reshaped the data according to the observations of interest.\nAlternatively, if the interview dates were spread across multiple columns, and we were interested in visualizing, within each village, how irrigation conflicts have changed over time. This would require for the interview date to be included in a single column rather than spread across multiple columns. Thus, we would need to transform the column names into values of a variable.\nWe can do both of these transformations with two tidyr functions, pivot_wider() and pivot_longer().",

    "section": "7.2 Pivoting wider",
    "text": "7.2 Pivoting wider\npivot_wider() takes three principal arguments:\n\nthe data\nthe names_from column variable whose values will become new column names.\nthe values_from column variable whose values will fill the new column variables.\n\nFurther arguments include values_fill which, if set, fills in missing values with the value provided.\nLet’s use pivot_wider() to transform interviews to create new columns for each item owned by a household. There are a couple of new concepts in this transformation, so let’s walk through it line by line. First we create a new object (interviews_items_owned) based on the interviews data frame.\n\ninterviews_items_owned &lt;- interviews %&gt;%\n\nThen we will actually need to make our data frame longer, because we have multiple items in a single cell. We will use a new function, separate_longer_delim(), from the tidyr package to separate the values of items_owned based on the presence of semi-colons (;). The values of this variable were multiple items separated by semi-colons, so this action creates a row for each item listed in a household’s possession. Thus, we end up with a long format version of the dataset, with multiple rows for each respondent. For example, if a respondent has a television and a solar panel, that respondent will now have two rows, one with “television” and the other with “solar panel” in the items_owned column.\n\nseparate_longer_delim(items_owned, delim = \";\") %&gt;%\n\nAfter this transformation, you may notice that the items_owned column contains NA values. This is because some of the respondents did not own any of the items in the interviewer’s list. We can use the replace_na() function to change these NA values to something more meaningful. The replace_na() function expects for you to give it a list() of columns that you would like to replace the NA values in, and the value that you would like to replace the NAs. This ends up looking like this:\n\nreplace_na(list(items_owned = \"no_listed_items\")) %&gt;%\n\nNext, we create a new variable named items_owned_logical, which has one value (TRUE) for every row. This makes sense, since each item in every row was owned by that household. We are constructing this variable so that when we spread the items_owned across multiple columns, we can fill the values of those columns with logical values describing whether the household did (TRUE) or did not (FALSE) own that particular item.\n\nmutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE) %&gt;%\n\n\nAt this point, we can also count the number of items owned by each household, which is equivalent to the number of rows per key_ID. We can do this with a group_by() and mutate() pipeline that works similar to group_by() and summarize() discussed in the previous episode but instead of creating a summary table, we will add another column called number_items. We use the n() function to count the number of rows within each group. However, there is one difficulty we need to take into account, namely those households that did not list any items. These households now have \"no_listed_items\" under items_owned. We do not want to count this as an item but instead show zero items. We can accomplish this using dplyr’s if_else() function that evaluates a condition and returns one value if true and another if false. Here, if the items_owned column is \"no_listed_items\", then a 0 is returned, otherwise, the number of rows per group is returned using n().\n\ngroup_by(key_ID) %&gt;% \n  mutate(number_items = if_else(items_owned == \"no_listed_items\", 0, n())) %&gt;% \n\nLastly, we use pivot_wider() to switch from long format to wide format. This creates a new column for each of the unique values in the items_owned column, and fills those columns with the values of items_owned_logical. We also declare that for items that are missing, we want to fill those cells with the value of FALSE instead of NA.\n\npivot_wider(names_from = items_owned,\n            values_from = items_owned_logical,\n            values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE))\n\n\nCombining the above steps, the chunk looks like this. Note that two new columns are created within the same mutate() call.\n\ninterviews_items_owned &lt;- interviews %&gt;%\n  separate_longer_delim(items_owned, delim = \";\") %&gt;%\n  replace_na(list(items_owned = \"no_listed_items\")) %&gt;%\n  group_by(key_ID) %&gt;%\n  mutate(items_owned_logical = TRUE,\n         number_items = if_else(items_owned == \"no_listed_items\", 0, n())) %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = items_owned,\n              values_from = items_owned_logical,\n              values_fill = list(items_owned_logical = FALSE))\n\nView the interviews_items_owned data frame. It should have r nrow(interviews) rows (the same number of rows you had originally), but extra columns for each item. How many columns were added? Notice that there is no longer a column titled items_owned. This is because there is a default parameter in pivot_wider() that drops the original column. The values that were in that column have now become columns named television, solar_panel, table, etc. You can use dim(interviews) and dim(interviews_wide) to see how the number of columns has changed between the two datasets.\nThis format of the data allows us to do interesting things, like make a table showing the number of respondents in each village who owned a particular item:\n\ninterviews_items_owned %&gt;%\n  filter(bicycle) %&gt;%\n  group_by(village) %&gt;%\n  count(bicycle)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   village [3]\n  village  bicycle     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;\n1 Chirodzo TRUE       17\n2 God      TRUE       23\n3 Ruaca    TRUE       20\n\n\nOr below we calculate the average number of items from the list owned by respondents in each village using the number_items column we created to count the items listed by each household.\n\ninterviews_items_owned %&gt;%\n    group_by(village) %&gt;%\n    summarize(mean_items = mean(number_items))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  village  mean_items\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Chirodzo       4.54\n2 God            3.98\n3 Ruaca          5.57",

This allows for us to change from specifying the data = argument within the ggplot function and instead pipe the data into the function.\n\nuse the ggplot() function and bind the plot to a specific data frame.\n\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot()\n\n\ndefine a mapping (using the aesthetic (aes) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g. as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc.\n\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items))\n\n\nadd ‘geoms’ – graphical representations of the data in the plot (points, lines, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms; we will use some common ones today, including:\n\ngeom_point() for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.\ngeom_boxplot() for, well, boxplots!\ngeom_line() for trend lines, time series, etc.\n\n\nTo add a geom to the plot use the + operator. Because we have two continuous variables, let’s use geom_point() first:\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe + in the ggplot2 package is particularly useful because it allows you to modify existing ggplot objects. This means you can easily set up plot templates and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above plot can also be generated with code like this, similar to the “intermediate steps” approach in the previous lesson:\n\n# Assign plot to a variable\ninterviews_plot &lt;- interviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items))\n\n# Draw the plot as a dot plot\ninterviews_plot +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneNotes\n\n\n\n\nAnything you put in the ggplot() function can be seen by any geom layers that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x- and y-axis mapping you set up in aes().\nYou can also specify mappings for a given geom independently of the mapping defined globally in the ggplot() function.\nThe + sign used to add new layers must be placed at the end of the line containing the previous layer. If, instead, the + sign is added at the beginning of the line containing the new layer, ggplot2 will not add the new layer and will return an error message.\n\n\n\n\n## This is the correct syntax for adding layers\ninterviews_plot +\n    geom_point()\n\n## This will not add the new layer and will return an error message\ninterviews_plot\n+ geom_point()",

    "section": "8.3 Building your plots iteratively",
    "text": "8.3 Building your plots iteratively\nBuilding plots with ggplot2 is typically an iterative process. We start by defining the dataset we’ll use, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For instance, when inspecting the plot we notice that points only appear at the intersection of whole numbers of no_membrs and number_items. Also, from a rough estimate, it looks like there are far fewer dots on the plot than there rows in our dataframe. This should lead us to believe that there may be multiple observations plotted on top of each other (e.g. three observations where no_membrs is 3 and number_items is 1).\nThere are two main ways to alleviate overplotting issues:\n\nchanging the transparency of the points\njittering the location of the points\n\nLet’s first explore option 1, changing the transparency of the points. What we mean when we say “transparency” we mean the opacity of point, or your ability to see through the point. We can control the transparency of the points with the alpha argument to geom_point. Values of alpha range from 0 to 1, with lower values corresponding to more transparent colors (an alpha of 1 is the default value). Specifically, an alpha of 0.1, would make a point one-tenth as opaque as a normal point. Stated differently ten points stacked on top of each other would correspond to a normal point.\nHere, we change the alpha to 0.5, in an attempt to help fix the overplotting. While the overplotting isn’t solved, adding transparency begins to address this problem, as the points where there are overlapping observations are darker (as opposed to lighter gray):\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat only helped a little bit with the overplotting problem, so let’s try option two. We can jitter the points on the plot, so that we can see each point in the locations where there are overlapping points. Jittering introduces a little bit of randomness into the position of our points. You can think of this process as taking the overplotted graph and giving it a tiny shake. The points will move a little bit side-to-side and up-and-down, but their position from the original plot won’t dramatically change. Note that this solution is suitable for plotting integer figures, while for numeric figures with decimals, geom_jitter() becomes inappropriate because it obscures the true value of the observation.\nWe can jitter our points using the geom_jitter() function instead of the geom_point() function, as seen below:\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_jitter()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe geom_jitter() function allows for us to specify the amount of random motion in the jitter, using the width and height arguments. When we don’t specify values for width and height, geom_jitter() defaults to 40% of the resolution of the data (the smallest change that can be measured). Hence, if we would like less spread in our jitter than was default, we should pick values between 0.1 and 0.4. Experiment with the values to see how your plot changes.\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5,\n                width = 0.2,\n                height = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our final change, we can also add colours for all the points by specifying a color argument inside the geom_jitter() function:\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5,\n                color = \"blue\",\n                width = 0.2,\n                height = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo colour each village in the plot differently, you could use a vector as an input to the argument color. However, because we are now mapping features of the data to a colour, instead of setting one colour for all points, the colour of the points now needs to be set inside a call to the aes function. When we map a variable in our data to the colour of the points, ggplot2 will provide a different colour corresponding to the different values of the variable. We will continue to specify the value of alpha, width, and height outside of the aes function because we are using the same value for every point. ggplot2 understands both the Commonwealth English and American English spellings for colour, i.e., you can use either color or colour. Here is an example where we color points by the village of the observation:\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +\n    geom_jitter(aes(color = village), alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a positive trend between number of household members and number of items owned (from the list provided). Additionally, this trend does not appear to be different by village.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneNotes\n\n\n\nAs you will learn, there are multiple ways to plot the a relationship between variables. Another way to plot data with overlapping points is to use the geom_count plotting function. The geom_count() function makes the size of each point representative of the number of data items of that type and the legend gives point sizes associated to particular numbers of items.\n\ninterviews_plotting %&gt;%\n   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +\n   geom_count()",

This would be especially useful if we had a large number of villages that we had sampled, as a large number of side-by-side bars will become more difficult to read.\nggplot2 has a special technique called faceting that allows the user to split one plot into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset.

We can calculate the percent of people in each village who own each item and then create a faceted series of bar plots where each plot is a particular item. First we need to calculate the percentage of people in each village who own each item:\n\npercent_items &lt;- interviews_plotting %&gt;%\n    group_by(village) %&gt;%\n    summarize(across(bicycle:no_listed_items, ~ sum(.x) / n() * 100)) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(bicycle:no_listed_items, names_to = \"items\", values_to = \"percent\")\n\nTo calculate this percentage data frame, we needed to use the across() function within a summarize() operation. Unlike the previous example with a single wall type variable, where each response was exactly one of the types specified, people can (and do) own more than one item. So there are multiple columns of data (one for each item), and the percentage calculation needs to be repeated for each column.\nCombining summarize() with across() allows us to specify first, the columns to be summarized (bicycle:no_listed_items) and then the calculation. Because our calculation is a bit more complex than is available in a built-in function, we define a new formula:\n\n~ indicates that we are defining a formula,\nsum(.x) gives the number of people owning that item by counting the number of TRUE values (.x is shorthand for the column being operated on),\nand n() gives the current group size.\n\nAfter the summarize() operation, we have a table of percentages with each item in its own column, so a pivot_longer() is required to transform the table into an easier format for plotting.

We can add “\\n” in the string for the title to insert a new line:\n\npercent_items %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n    facet_wrap(~ items) +\n    labs(title = \"Percent of respondents in each village \\n who owned each item\",\n         x = \"Village\",\n         y = \"Percent of Respondents\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12, angle = 45,\n                                     hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12),\n          text = element_text(size = 16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the changes you created better than the default theme, you can save them as an object to be able to easily apply them to other plots you may create. We can also add plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5) to centre the title:\n\ngrey_theme &lt;- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12,\n                                               angle = 45, hjust = 0.5,\n                                               vjust = 0.5),\n                    axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12),\n                    text = element_text(size = 16),\n                    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\npercent_items %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n    facet_wrap(~ items) +\n    labs(title = \"Percent of respondents in each village \\n who owned each item\",\n         x = \"Village\",\n         y = \"Percent of Respondents\") +\n    grey_theme",
